This script uses the Salmon quantification output, a samplesheet file and a gene annotation file to perform:
- Exploratory Data Analyis with a sample correlation and sample distance heatmap, and a PCA plot,
- Differential Expression Analysis,
- GO Enrichment Analysis and
- Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

To run the program and save the output define your working directory. The path has to be entered in line 34 as following:\
**wddir = "yourPATH/"**

In this directory the following files and subdirectories should exist:
- sample specific Salmon output files with quant.sf files
- sample.txt
- salmon_tx2gene.tsv

see [Salmon_QuantFiles](https://github.com/NichKu/RNA-seq-Analysis/tree/master/Salmon_QuantFiles)
