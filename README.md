This script uses the Salmon quantification output, a samplesheet file and a gene annotation file to perform:
- Exploratory Data Analyis with a sample correlation and sample distance heatmap, and a PCA plot,
- Differential Expression Analysis,
- GO Enrichment Analysis and
- Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

To run the program and save the output define your working directory which also contains the salmon output directories. The path has to be entered in line 34 as following:\
**wddir = "yourPATH/"**
